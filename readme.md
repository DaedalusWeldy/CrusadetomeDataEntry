# Crusadetome Data Entry Tool


## What does the app do?
This app provides a clean interface for submitting data from Warhammer 40k's units, specifically the 10th edition of the game. The user will fill out all of the relevant fields, and once done will be provided with a clean JSON file of the unit data, ready to download to their PC. These files can later be imported into a future database.


## Why is such a tool needed? Isn't there an app for 40k already?
Warhammer40k has almost no digital footprint. It's unit data is locked behind a subscription to an app, as well as the purchase of a unit's corresponding codex. This project looks to take the first step in digitizing the data from 40k's various monsters, soldiers and vehicles into a format that can be used by another program or site.
